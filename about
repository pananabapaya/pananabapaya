Hi, this the repository for a personal website. It is also a stepping stone for future projects, some of which I am listing down here:
- A website to host personal portfolio
  - This will also host my blogs and articles and writings in general
- A website to host stories about and on buses 
- A website to host the various articles I have read, and will rate as per the enjoyability, new content, display 
- Something about trains and buses and cycling

Yea, that's about it. Halt here
